abstract: 
    For a number of years now work has been proceeding in order to bring to perfection the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such a machine is the "Turbo-Encabulator."

## Introduction

Recent years have seen a growing appreciation that black-box machine learning methods can understand data better if equipped with geometric priors, both globally [cite TDA methods] and locally [cite heat & wave, energy]. This is especially true for graph-structured data. The usefulness of graphs as a general data representation comes at a cost: that data is “ripped from its context”. To take an example, when point cloud data becomes a graph, the *extrinsic* geometric perspective afforded by a bird’s eye view of the points is reduced to an *intrinsic* perspective – the ‘ant’s eye’ view.

#| label: torus
#| fig-cap: Diffusion Curvature vs Gaussian Curvature of the Torus
#| fig-alt: The diffusion curvature corresponds closely to the gaussian curvature of the torus
from diffusion_curvature.utils import plot_3d
from diffusion_curvature.datasets import torus
from diffusion_curvature.core import DiffusionCurvature, get_adaptive_graph
X_torus, ks_torus = torus(2000)
DC = DiffusionCurvature()
G_torus = get_adaptive_graph(X_torus, k = 5, alpha = 1)
ks_computed = DC.curvature(G_torus, dim=2, t = 25)
plot_3d(X_torus, ks_computed, colorbar=True)
