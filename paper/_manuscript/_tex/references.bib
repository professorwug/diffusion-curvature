	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02615},
	abstract = {We introduce an intrinsic estimator for the scalar curvature of a data set presented as a finite metric space. Our estimator depends only on the metric structure of the data and not on an embedding in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$. We show that the estimator is consistent in the sense that for points sampled from a probability measure on a compact Riemannian manifold, the estimator converges to the scalar curvature as the number of points increases. To justify its use in applications, we show that the estimator is stable with respect to perturbations of the metric structure, e.g., noise in the sample or error estimating the intrinsic metric. We validate our estimator experimentally on synthetic data that is sampled from manifolds with specified curvature.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04369},
	abstract = {In this work, we study the evolution of the loss Hessian across many classification tasks in order to understand the effect the curvature of the loss has on the training dynamics. Whereas prior work has focused on how different learning rates affect the loss Hessian observed during training, we also analyze the effects of model initialization, architectural choices, and common training heuristics such as gradient clipping and learning rate warmup. Our results demonstrate that successful model and hyperparameter choices allow the early optimization trajectory to either avoid -- or navigate out of -- regions of high curvature and into flatter regions that tolerate a higher learning rate. Our results suggest a unifying perspective on how disparate mitigation strategies for training instability ultimately address the same underlying failure mode of neural network optimization, namely poor conditioning. Inspired by the conditioning perspective, we show that learning rate warmup can improve training stability just as much as batch normalization, layer normalization, {MetaInit}, {GradInit}, and Fixup initialization.},

With a particular choice of the density function \${\textbackslash}rho\$, we obtain a localized gradient estimate, which in turns allow us to derive a Bonnet-Myers type diameter bound for graphs with positive entropic Ricci curvature. However, the case of the hypercubes indicates that the bound may be not optimal (where \${\textbackslash}theta\$ is chosen to be logarithmic mean by default). If \${\textbackslash}theta\$ is arithmetic mean, the Bakry-Emery criterion can be recovered and the diameter bound is optimal as it can be attained by the hypercubes.},

Definition of Curvature Let (Ω, μ) be a probability space and L a self-adjoint negative but not necessarily bounded operator on L2(μ) given by Lf(x) := ∫ (f(y)− f(x))K(x, y)μ(dy) (1) where K is a non negative symmetric kernel. Obviously L remains unchanged if we change K on the diagonal. By Pt = e we denote the continuous contraction semigroup on L2(μ) with generator L. We will assume that Pt is ergodic and that there exists an algebra A ⊆ n {domL} of bounded functions which is a form core of L. Then the Beurling–Deny condition implies that Pt is a symmetric Markov semigroup, i.e., Pt preserves positivity and extends to a continuous contraction semigroup on Lp(μ) for all 1 ≤ p   0. Let us say a a word about the motivation for this definition. Assume L is the Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, then},

	title = {Spectral Properties of Hypergraph Laplacian and Approximation Algorithms},
	volume = {65},
	doi = {10.1145/3178123},
	abstract = {The celebrated Cheeger’s Inequality (Alon and Milman 1985; Alon 1986) establishes a bound on the edge expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.

In this article, we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum. Since the operator is nonlinear, we have to exploit other properties of the diffusion process to recover the Cheeger’s Inequality that relates hyperedge expansion with the “second eigenvalue” of the resulting Laplacian. However, we show that higher-order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework.

Since higher-order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher-order Cheeger-like inequalities. For any k ∈ N, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an O(log r)-approximation to the kth procedural minimizer, where r is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the {SSE} hypothesis (introduced by Raghavendra and Steurer (2010)) for constant values of k.

Moreover, using the factor-preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in graphs.},

            We present an efficient method to conformally parameterize 3D mesh data sets to the plane. The idea behind our method is to concentrate all the 3D curvature at a small number of select mesh vertices, called cone singularities, and then cut the mesh through those singular vertices to obtain disk topology. The singular vertices are chosen automatically. As opposed to most previous methods, our flattening process involves only the solution of linear systems of Poisson equations, thus is very efficient. Our method is shown to be faster than existing methods, yet generates parameterizations having comparable quasi‐conformal distortion.},
