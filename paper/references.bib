  abstract = {Abstract             We present an efficient method to conformally parameterize 3D mesh data sets to the plane. The idea behind our method is to concentrate all the 3D curvature at a small number of select mesh vertices, called cone singularities, and then cut the mesh through those singular vertices to obtain disk topology. The singular vertices are chosen automatically. As opposed to most previous methods, our flattening process involves only the solution of linear systems of Poisson equations, thus is very efficient. Our method is shown to be faster than existing methods, yet generates parameterizations having comparable quasi‐conformal distortion.},

This curvature, termed coarse scalar curvature, extends a recent definition of Ricci curvature for Markov chains on metric spaces by Ollivier [Journal of Functional Analysis 256 (2009) 810–864], and is related to the scalar curvature when the hypergraph arises naturally from a Riemannian manifold. We investigate basic theoretical properties of the coarse scalar curvature and obtain several bounds. Empirical experiments demonstrate that coarse scalar curvatures detects “bridges” across connected components in hypergraphs, akin to the behavior of coarse Ricci curvatures on graphs.},

Our results demonstrate that successful model and hyperparameter choices allow the early optimization trajectory to either avoid -- or navigate out of -- regions of high curvature and into flatter regions that tolerate a higher learning rate. Our results suggest a unifying perspective on how disparate mitigation strategies for training instability ultimately address the same underlying failure mode of neural network optimization, namely poor conditioning. Inspired by the conditioning perspective, we show that learning rate warmup can improve training stability just as much as batch normalization, layer normalization, MetaInit, GradInit, and Fixup initialization.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph. In this article, we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum. Since the operator is nonlinear, we have to exploit other properties of the diffusion process to recover the Cheeger’s Inequality that relates hyperedge expansion with the “second eigenvalue” of the resulting Laplacian. However, we show that higher-order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework. Since higher-order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher-order Cheeger-like inequalities. For any k ∈ N, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an O(log r)-approximation to the kth procedural minimizer, where r is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by Raghavendra and Steurer (2010)) for constant values of k. Moreover, using the factor-preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in graphs.},

Diffusion EMD can be computed in \{Õ\}(n) time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.},
