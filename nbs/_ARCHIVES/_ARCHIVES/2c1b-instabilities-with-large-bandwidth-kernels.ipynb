    "In the first instance, the saddle could be a canary in the coal mine. Having the most volume, it is also the sparsest. A '1' appears when the term (spread of manifold)/(spread in Rd) is zero. First the kernel reaches a size such that the (hyper)saddle has zero spread -- i.e. everything has *distance* zero to the initial point, in terms of phate distances. Then, as the kernel becomes a bit larger, this effect overtakes the plane. Now the denominator becomes zero, and it all blows to pieces."

    "So the PHATE distance computation is the proximal cause. When the kernel bandwidth is sufficiently large, everything has distance zero to the origin -- or at least, everything within the *diffusion* has distance zero. This illuminates a troubling shortcut we had taken: the $t$ used for PHATE distances should always be smaller than that used for diffusion. *But how small?* The wasserstein formulation, in contrast to the Entropic, has two moving pieces. The measuring stick is getting smaller or larger in step with the kernel or $t$. "
